This code is a Go program that retrieves data from a Google Sheet. The code consists of several functions:

tokenFromFile: This function reads a token from a local file. The token is used to authenticate the application to the Google Sheets API.

retrieveToken: This function retrieves an OAuth token using the tokenFromFile function. The token is used to access the Google Sheets API.

configService: This function sets up a new Google Sheets service using the OAuth token obtained in the previous step.

main: This is the main function of the program. It retrieves data from a specific range in a Google Sheet using the configService function. The data is then printed to the console.

The code uses the google.golang.org/api/sheets/v4 package to interact with the Google Sheets API. The google.golang.org/api/option package is used to provide the OAuth token to the service. The golang.org/x/oauth2 package is used to decode the OAuth token from a local file. The encoding/json package is used to decode the token from a JSON file. The log package is used to log errors. The os package is used to open the token file.
